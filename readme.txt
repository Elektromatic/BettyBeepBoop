C  This Max 8 patch creates generative electronic music. It creates melody and 
C  bass waveforms using a frequency masking patch that employs the ioscbank~ 
C  object. Euclidian rhythms are use to create the melodic and percussive rhythms.
C
C  The melodic content is pass through a low pass gate filter and a dattorro
C  reverb for further effect.
C
C  Please see https://youtu.be/ocw5UhBsscc for an example of the use of this Max patch.
